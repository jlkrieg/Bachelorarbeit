Above 1 TeV up to around 300 TeV an array of   Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs) will cover several kilometres on the   ground. The Compact High-Energy Camera (CHEC) is a proposed option   for the camera of the SSTs. CHEC contains 2048 pixels of physical   size about 6 mm×6 mm, leading to a field of view of   over 8 degrees. Electronics based on custom ASICs (TARGET) and FPGAs   sample incoming signals at a gigasample per second and provide a   flexible triggering scheme. Waveforms for every pixel in every event   are read out without loss at over 600 events per second. A telescope   prototype in Meudon, Paris, saw first Cherenkov light from air   showers in late 2015, using the first CHEC prototype. Research and   development for CHEC is currently focussed on taking advantage of   the latest generation of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs).}
